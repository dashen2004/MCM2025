abstract = {In this paper, we construct several models that try to predict a country’s success at the Summer Olympic Games. Our data set consists of total scores for over 271 sporting events for 195 countries that were represented at the 1996 Summer Games and information we gathered on 17 independent variables. We build linear regression models and neural network models and compare the predictions of both types of models. Overall, the best neural network model outperformed the best regression model. Scope and purpose Every four years, an enormous amount of attention is focused on the Summer Olympic Games. Sports fans and analysts do their best to predict the outcomes with respect to many sporting events and the overall performance of nations competing at the Olympics. In this paper, we develop and compare socio-economic-based models for predicting the success of nations at the Summer Olympics.}

abstract = {Forecasting the number of Olympic medals for each nation is highly relevant for different stakeholders: Ex ante, sports betting companies can determine the odds while sponsors and media companies can allocate their resources to promising teams. Ex post, sports politicians and managers can benchmark the performance of their teams and evaluate the drivers of success. We apply machine learning, more specifically a two-staged Random Forest, to a dataset containing socioeconomic variables of 206 countries (1991–2020). For the first time, we outperform the more traditional naïve forecast for four consecutive Olympics between 2008 and 2020.}
